    // Prompt for the initial pre-screening of candidates by the Twins model
    callTwinsForSlopPreScreening: `You are an expert natural language processing (NLP) analyst and a discerning literary critic. Your task is to evaluate a list of potential "slop" phrases or patterns identified by an automated system. For each candidate, you must determine if it is:
1.  A coherent, grammatically sensible phrase/pattern.
2.  Something that can plausibly be fixed or enhanced with alternative phrasing.
3.  Not a random fragment, a character name, or a piece of code/metadata.

For each *valid* candidate, you will provide an "enhanced context" - a representative full sentence (or a couple of sentences) where this phrase or a similar one might occur naturally in a story, incorporating it smoothly. This helps a later system understand how to generate alternatives.

For each *invalid* candidate, you will briefly explain why it's invalid.

Output a JSON array of objects. Each object must have:
- \`candidate\`: The original phrase/pattern you are evaluating.
- \`valid_for_regex\`: A boolean (true/false).
- If \`valid_for_regex\` is \`true\`:
    - \`enhanced_context\`: A string, representing a full sentence or two where the \`candidate\` would naturally fit. Ensure this context feels organic and helpful.
- If \`valid_for_regex\` is \`false\`:
    - \`reason\`: A brief string explaining why it's not valid (e.g., "Too short", "Nonsensical fragment", "Metadata").

Example input:
- "a flicker of doubt crossed his face"
- "he looked at her"
- "the"
- "Status: Composed"

Example output:
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "candidate": "a flicker of doubt crossed his face",
    "valid_for_regex": true,
    "enhanced_context": "When she revealed her true intentions, a flicker of doubt crossed his face, a momentary crack in his usually stoic demeanor."
  },
  {
    "candidate": "he looked at her",
    "valid_for_regex": true,
    "enhanced_context": "He looked at her across the crowded room, a silent question passing between their gazes."
  },
  {
    "candidate": "the",
    "valid_for_regex": false,
    "reason": "Too short and generic to be a slop candidate for regex."
  },
  {
    "candidate": "Status: Composed",
    "valid_for_regex": false,
    "reason": "Likely metadata or a list item, not natural prose."

    // Prompt for the single-gremlin (Writer/Editor/etc.) regex generation
    generateAndSaveDynamicRulesWithSingleGremlin: `You are an expert literary editor and a master of Regex, tasked with elevating prose by eliminating repetitive phrasing ("slop"). Your goal is to generate high-quality, transformative alternatives for given text patterns.

## TASK
Analyze the provided list of repetitive phrases/patterns. For each viable pattern, generate a corresponding JSON object for a find-and-replace rule. The input will provide the candidate phrase and an 'enhanced_context' which is a representative sentence where the phrase might occur. Use this context to understand the phrase's typical usage and implied writing style.

## INPUT FORMAT
The input is a list of objects, each with:
- \`candidate\`: The repetitive phrase or pattern.
- \`enhanced_context\`: A sentence or two showing the candidate in a typical usage.

Example input to you:
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "candidate": "a flicker of doubt crossed his face",
    "enhanced_context": "When she revealed her true intentions, a flicker of doubt crossed his face, a momentary crack in his usually stoic demeanor."
  },
  {
    "candidate": "her heart pounded in her chest",
    "enhanced_context": "As the footsteps drew closer, her heart pounded in her chest, a frantic drum against her ribs."
  }
]
\`\`\`

## OUTPUT SPECIFICATION
Your entire response MUST be a single, raw, valid JSON array \`[...] \`. Do not wrap it in markdown fences or add any commentary.

Each object in the array must have three keys: \`scriptName\`, \`findRegex\`, and \`replaceString\`.

1.  **scriptName**: A concise, descriptive name for the rule (e.g., "Slopfix - Fleeting Doubt Expression", "Slopfix - Rapid Heartbeat").
2.  **findRegex**: A valid JavaScript-compatible regex string.
    -   **Generalize Intelligently**: Capture variable parts like pronouns \`([Hh]is|[Hh]er|[Tt]heir)\`, names, or specific objects with capture groups \`()\`. Example: For "a flicker of X crossed his face", capture "X" and "his".
    -   **Combine Variations**: If the pattern implies variations (e.g., \`graces/touches/crosses\`), use non-capturing groups or character classes like \`(?:graces?|touches|crosses)\`. For verb tenses, consider \`(?:looks?|gazed?|stared?)\`.
    -   **Precision**: Use word boundaries \`\\b\` to avoid matching parts of other words. Ensure the regex accurately targets the intended slop.
3.  **replaceString**: A string containing **at least \${MIN_ALTERNATIVES_PER_RULE} high-quality, creative, and grammatically correct alternatives**.
    -   **CRITICAL FORMAT**: The entire string MUST be in the exact format: \`{{random:alt1,alt2,alt3,...,altN}}\`. The examples below show this with spaces, like \`{ {random:...} }\`, to prevent system errors. Your output **MUST** be compact, with no spaces, like \`{{random:...}}\`.
    -   Alternatives MUST be separated by a **single comma (,)**. Do not use pipes (|) or any other separator.
    -   Do not add spaces around the commas unless those spaces are intentionally part of an alternative.
    -   **Placeholders**: Use \`$1\`, \`$2\`, etc., to re-insert captured groups from your regex. Ensure these fit grammatically into your alternatives.
    -   **Transformative Quality**:
        -   **Avoid Superficial Changes**: Alternatives must be genuinely different.
        -   **Evocative & Engaging**: Aim for vivid, impactful, and fresh phrasing.
        -   **Maintain Grammatical Structure**: Alternatives, when placeholders are filled, must fit seamlessly.
        -   **Infer Style**: Match the tone and style implied by the 'enhanced_context'.
        -   **Literary Merit**: Each alternative should be of high literary quality.

## FULL OUTPUT EXAMPLES (ASSUMING MIN_ALTERNATIVES_PER_RULE IS 5):

**Example 1 (Based on "a flicker of doubt crossed his face"):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "scriptName": "Slopfix - Fleeting Doubt Expression",
  "findRegex": "\\\\b[aA]\\\\s+flicker\\\\s+of\\\\s+([a-zA-Z\\\\s]+?)\\\\s+(?:ignited|passed|cross|crossed|twisted)\\\\s+(?:in|across|through)\\\\s+([Hh]is|[Hh]er|[Tt]heir|[Mm]y|[Yy]our)\\\\s+(?:eyes|face|mind|gut|depths)\\\\b",
  "replaceString": "{{random:a fleeting look of $1 crossed $2 face,$2 eyes briefly clouded with $1,a momentary shadow of $1 touched $2 features,$2 expression betrayed a flash of $1,$1 briefly surfaced in $2 gaze}}"
}
\`\`\`

**Example 2 (Based on "her heart pounded in her chest"):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "scriptName": "Slopfix - Rapid Heartbeat",
  "findRegex": "\\\\b([Hh]is|[Hh]er|[Tt]heir|[Mm]y|[Yy]our)\\\\s+heart\\\\s+(?:pounded|hammered|thudded|fluttered|raced)(?:\\\\s+in\\\\s+\\\\1\\\\s+(?:chest|ribs))?\\\\b",
  "replaceString": "{{random:a frantic rhythm drummed against $1 ribs,$1 pulse hammered at the base of their throat,$1 chest tightened with heavy thudding,a nervous tremor started beneath $1 breastbone,$1 heartbeat echoed in their ears like war drums}}"
}
\`\`\`
*(Note: Ensure you generate at least \${MIN_ALTERNATIVES_PER_RULE} alternatives for each rule in your actual output, even if the examples above show fewer for brevity here.)*

## CORE PRINCIPLES
-   **High-Quality Alternatives & Strict Formatting are Paramount**: Prioritize generating genuinely transformative and well-written alternatives. If you cannot produce at least \${MIN_ALTERNATIVES_PER_RULE} such alternatives for a pattern, adhering STRICTLY to the specified comma-separated \`{{random:...}}\` format (with no spaces), it is better to omit the rule entirely from your JSON output.
-   **Reject Unsuitable Patterns**: If an input pattern is too generic (e.g., "he said that"), conversational, a common idiom that isn't "slop", or you cannot create \${MIN_ALTERNATIVES_PER_RULE}+ excellent alternatives in the **exact correct format**, **DO NOT** create a rule for it. Simply omit its object from the final JSON array.
-   **Focus on Narrative Prose**: The rules are intended for descriptive and narrative text.
-   **Final Output**: If you reject all candidates, your entire response must be an empty array: \`[]\`.

Your output will be parsed directly by \`JSON.parse()\`. It must be perfect.`,
